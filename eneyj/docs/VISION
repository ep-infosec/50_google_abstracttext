     THE FIVE BIG VISIONS

  I) Imagine a programming language that is collaboratively grown and
     maintained, to which everyone can contribute to, and that everyone may
     share in.

 II) Imagine a programming language that truly is accessible not only to
     speakers of English, but that is open to billions of people more who do
     not have to learn English first in order to learn how to program.

III) Imagine a programming language that is truly geared to a mobile first
     world, and where the execution of the code and the data flow become
     intelligently managed and distributed.

 IV) Imagine a programming language where you write code only once and then it
     can be run anywhere by anyone - even from programs written in other
     programming languages.

  V) Imagine a programming language that allows us to make the next big leap in
     knowledge representation.
